# JokesterBashScript
This is a simple Bash Script to get told a random joke. This was an assignment during my internship to practice scripting in Bash and become more familiar with Linux Bash Commands. This shows the usage of Bash variables, putting those into an array, and then returning a random index back.

# To Run Bash Script
Download file in wanted directory
In the terminal, enter bash jokester.sh or ./jokester.sh

#How It Should Function
1. Ask the user for any inputs
2. Display a random joke set up
3. Ask the user for any inputs
4. Display joke punchline
